# Hello World!
## This is a test post because my husband is making me apply new knowledge.

**On github**
- check that the repo name suits you. remember there are special rules for *hosting* 
- <a href=#>word</a>

_Locally or in the GH GUI_
- Customise your _config.yml (mostly done for minima template)
- Customise your about.md (leaving credits to the tech's used after your content is a bonus ~I think)

__Separately__
- set up a cname on your dns/host pointing your desired domain to shanapote.github.io

__Posts__
- live in the _posts folder
- filename should have a date but really doesn't matter
- date in the tags is when it will show and what will show as post date
- I find it easier to locally create the posts, git add, git commit and git push them...you may like the web GUI better but _edits are stored_
