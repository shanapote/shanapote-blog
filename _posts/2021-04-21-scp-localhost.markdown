# Todo
- Clone this repo locally.
    1 on the repo tab copy the http link
    2 open a CLI to the directory where the local reop will live, type 'git clone ' and paste the link

```
__locally__
- Customise your _config.yml (mostly done for minima template)
- Customise your about.md (leaving credits to the tech's used after your content is a bunus ~I think)

- set up a cname on your dns/host pointing your desired domain to shanapote.github.io
