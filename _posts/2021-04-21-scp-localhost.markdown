# Write stuff
## future date to hide

# Todo
- Clone this repo locally.
    1 on the repo tab copy the http link
    2 open a CLI to the directory where the local reop will live, type 'git clone ' and paste the link

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/shanapote/shanapote.github.io.git
```
__On github__
- check that the repo name suits you. remember there are special rules for hosting

__Locally or in the GH GUI__
- Customise your _config.yml (mostly done for minima template)
- Customise your about.md (leaving credits to the tech's used after your content is a bunus ~I think)

__Separately__
- set up a cname on your dns/host pointing your desired domain to shanapote.github.io

__Posts__
- live in the _posts folder
- filename should have a date but really doesn't matter
- date in the tags is when it will show and what will show as post date
- I find it easier to locally create the posts, git add, git commit and git push them...you may like the web GUI better but _edits are stored_
